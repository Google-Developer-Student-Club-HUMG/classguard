## Challenge: school violence

In many countries, a significant percentage of students report experiencing bullying in school. For example, in one survey, over one-third of students in 39 countries reported being bullied in the past month.

Physical fights between students are also common in many countries. In one survey, over one-third of students in 38 countries reported being in a physical fight in the past year.

Sexual violence is also a concern in some countries. In one survey, over one-third of female students in 22 countries reported experiencing sexual violence at some point in their lives.

Some forms of violence are more prevalent in certain regions. For example, in one survey, physical fighting was more common in African and Eastern Mediterranean countries, while bullying was more common in European and Western Pacific countries.
