## 1. Challenge

In many countries, a significant percentage of students report experiencing bullying in school. 
For example, in one survey, over one-third of students in 39 countries reported being bullied in the past month.

Physical fights between students are also common in many countries. 
In one survey, over one-third of students in 38 countries reported being in a physical fight in the past year.

Sexual violence is also a concern in some countries. 
In one survey, over one-third of female students in 22 countries reported experiencing sexual violence at some point in their lives.

Some forms of violence are more prevalent in certain regions. 
For example, in one survey, physical fighting was more common in African and Eastern Mediterranean countries, 
while bullying was more common in European and Western Pacific countries.

## 2. What does our solution solve?

Preventing school violence solves many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals

Target 1. Poverty alleviation - Education is one of the important factors to help improve living conditions and reduce poverty. However, if school violence is left unchecked, it can have negative consequences for the health and education of students.

Target 3, Health and Welfare - School is the main environment for students to develop health and psychosocial development. However, school violence can cause mental health problems and affect children's development.

Target 4: Quality Education - School violence can reduce the quality of education and create an unsafe learning environment for students.

Target 5: Gender Equality - School violence can affect students not only in terms of health and education but also gender and physical.

Target 10: Reduce Inequality - Preventing school violence is one way to reduce inequality in education and create a fair learning environment for all students.

Target 16: Peace, Equity and Decent Work - School violence can reduce students' ability to learn and affect their ability to find work later in life.
