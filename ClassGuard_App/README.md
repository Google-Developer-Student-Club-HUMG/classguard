A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

```bash
brew install automake
brew install libtool
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

To add the TensorFlowLiteC.framework successfully and avoid the compile error, download the .zip file, unpack it. Then move this folder (TensorFlowLiteC.framework) into your pub.dev cache folder: ~/pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/tflite_flutter-0.9.0/ios/ (macOS).

Run flutter clean && flutter pub get,
then pod install in your ios folder.

This should work ðŸ˜Ž

Just FYI, I only ran the project for iOS, so if you're wanting to add Android just 
```
flutter create . --platforms=android
```
inside the root of the project folder.
